Alpha-beta search in Ocaml
--------------------------

A simple Othello (aka reversi) [1] implementation that uses alpha-beta search
for its AI engine.

To build the main executable, run 'ocamlbuild brabantio.native'. This will
produce an executable 'brabantio.native' file in the current directory.

To build the documentation, run 'ocamlbuild .docdir/index.html'.

Brabantio is Desdemona's father.
